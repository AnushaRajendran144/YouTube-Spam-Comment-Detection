## 📄 Abstract
*Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and classify spam comments on YouTube videos to improve user experience and platform safety.*

## 📊 Key Results & Methodology
This research conducted a comparative analysis of six machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model for spam detection.

**Algorithms Evaluated:**
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Linear Classification
* AdaBoost
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree

**🏆 Result:**
The **AdaBoost Classifier** achieved the highest performance with **91.39% accuracy** and an **F1-Score of 0.90**, outperforming other models like SVM (90.3%) and Random Forest (89.2%).
